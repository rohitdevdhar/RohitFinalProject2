# NBA Player Finder App

## About The Project
As a fan of the NBA, I was inspired to make a basketball related app for my first experience using SwiftUI.

The app is fairly basic but definitely took some time to develop. The basic premise behind the app is that one will be able to find any player after searching their last name, and when clicking on their player, they will be able to view the player's profile, which includes statistics like, height, weight, team, etc.

## Project Details and Features
This app is powered by the BallDontLieAPI, which has a large database of NBA players, and their statistics.

The user of the app will be able to search up a last name of an NBA Player, and get all the results of said last name. The user will be able to click on any specific player they are looking for and obtain their basic statistics.
